# The Office  

For this Tidy Tuesday I analyzed the overall sentiment (positive vs negative) of each character based on their spoken dialogue.  

Check out my [blog post](https://robin-sifre.netlify.com/post/tidy/tidytues-theoffice/) for more in-depth information.  

Tidy Tuesday also did a [screen cast](http://optimumsportsperformance.com/blog/tidyx-episode-2-sentiment-analysis-word-clouds/) where they did an in-depth walk through of my code.
