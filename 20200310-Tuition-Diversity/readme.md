I've recently started to participate in [Tidy Tuesday](https://thomasmock.netlify.com/post/tidytuesday-a-weekly-social-data-project-in-r/), a weekly social data project in R.  

This week, they shared an [extremely rich dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-03-10), on college tuition, diversity, and salary.  


For more detailed information please checkout my [blog post](https://robin-sifre.netlify.app/post/tidy/tidytues-tuition/).
